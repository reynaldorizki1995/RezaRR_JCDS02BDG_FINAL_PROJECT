              <p class="lead">Airbnb is a internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. It allows you to, for example, rent out your home for a week while youâ€™re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. One challenge that Airbnb hosts face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter by criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type, and more. 
                  The aim of this project is to propose a data-driven solution, by using machine learning to predict rental price.</p>
